execute the code step by step:\n1. The function `countCompleteSubarrays` is defined, which takes a single argument `nums`.\n2. The function is called with the argument `[5, 5, 5, 5]`, so within the function, `nums` is `[5, 5, 5, 5]`.\n3. The variable `m` is initialized to the length of the set of `nums`, which is `len(set([5, 5, 5, 5])) = 1`.\n4. The variable `n` is initialized to the length of `nums`, which is `len([5, 5, 5, 5]) = 4`.\n5. The variable `ans` is initialized to `0`.\n6. The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 3`.\n   - For `i = 0`, the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 3`. The set `s` is created and updated with each element of `nums` from index `0` to `3`. After the inner loop, `s` contains all unique elements of `nums`, which is `{5}`. Since `len(s) == m` (1 == 1), `ans` is incremented by 1, making `ans = 1`.\n   - For `i = 1`, the inner loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = 3`. Similar to the previous iteration, `s` will contain `{5}`, and `ans` is incremented again, making `ans = 2`.\n   - For `i = 2`, the inner loop runs from `j = 2` to `j = 3`. Again, `s` will contain `{5}`, and `ans` is incremented, making `ans = 3`.\n   - For `i = 3`, the inner loop runs from `j = 3` to `j = 3`. `s` will contain `{5}`, and `ans` is incremented, making `ans = 4`.\n7. The function returns `ans`, which is `4`.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we realize that the function is designed to count subarrays where the number of unique elements equals `m`. In this case, `m` is 1 because there is only one unique element in `nums`. The function checks if the number of unique elements in the subarray from index `i` to `j` is equal to `m`. Since every subarray in this case contains only the element `5`, the condition `len(s) == m` is always true, and `ans` is incremented for every subarray. There are `n * (n + 1) / 2 = 4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 10` subarrays in total, but since `m` is 1, every subarray is counted, resulting in `ans = 10`.\n\nBut the function logic is flawed, and it should only count subarrays where the number of unique elements is exactly `m`. Given that `m` is 1 and every subarray contains only one unique element, the correct count is actually the number of subarrays, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2 = 4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 10`. However, due to the flawed logic, the function will increment `ans` for every subarray, leading to `ans = 10`.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the function, we see that the function is designed to count subarrays where the number of unique elements is exactly `m`.
