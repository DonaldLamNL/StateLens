The function `checkArray` is defined, which takes two arguments: `nums` (a list of integers) and `k` (an integer).\n2. The function is called with `nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0]` and `k = 3`.\n3. The length of `nums` is calculated as `n = 6`.\n4. An array `tag` of length `n + 1` initialized to 0 is created.\n5. The variable `sh` (short for shift) is initialized to 0.\n6. We iterate over the range of `n` (from 0 to 5):\n   - For `i = 0`: \n     - `sh` is updated to `0 + 0 = 0`.\n     - Check `nums[0] - sh < 0` is `2 - 0 >= 0`, so we proceed.\n     - Calculate `x = 2 - 0 = 2`.\n     - Since `i + k = 0 + 3 = 3 <= 6`, we update `sh` to `0 + 2 = 2` and `tag[3]` to `-2`.\n   - For `i = 1`: \n     - `sh` is updated to `2 + (-2) = 0`.\n     - Check `nums[1] - sh < 0` is `2 - 0 >= 0`, so we proceed.\n     - Calculate `x = 2 - 0 = 2`.\n     - Since `i + k = 1 + 3 = 4 <= 6`, we update `sh` to `0 + 2 = 2` and `tag[4]` to `-2`.\n   - For `i = 2`: \n     - `sh` is updated to `2 + (-2) = 0`.\n     - Check `nums[2] - sh < 0` is `3 - 0 >= 0`, so we proceed.\n     - Calculate `x = 3 - 0 = 3`.\n     - Since `i + k = 2 + 3 = 5 <= 6`, we update `sh` to `0 + 3 = 3` and `tag[5]` to `-3`.\n   - For `i = 3`: \n     - `sh` is updated to `3 + (-3) = 0`.\n     - Check `nums[3] - sh < 0` is `1 - 0 >= 0`, so we proceed.\n     - Calculate `x = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n     - Since `i + k = 3 + 3 = 6 <= 6`, we update `sh` to `0 + 1 = 1` and `tag[6]` to `-1`.\n   - For `i = 4`: \n     - `sh` is updated to `1 + (-1) = 0`.\n     - Check `nums[4] - sh < 0` is `1 - 0 >= 0`, so we proceed.\n     - Calculate `x = 1 - 0 = 1`.\n     - Since `i + k = 4 + 3 = 7 > 6`, we do not update `sh` or `tag`.\n   - For `i = 5`: \n     - `sh` is updated to `0 + 0 = 0`.\n     - Check `nums[5] - sh < 0` is `0 - 0 >= 0`, so we proceed.\n     - Calculate `x = 0 - 0 = 0`.\n     - Since `i + k = 5 + 3 = 8 > 6`, we do not update `sh` or `tag`.\n7. After the loop, `sh` remains 0, and the function returns `True`.\n</think>\n<answer> checkArray(nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0], k = 3) == True </answer>"], "solutions": ["checkArray(nums = [2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0], k = 3) == True"]}

The function `shortestBeautifulSubstring` is defined, which takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `k`.\n2. The function is called with the arguments `s = '1011'` and `k = 2`.\n3. The length of `s` is calculated as `n = 4`.\n4. The variable `res` is initialized to `(float('inf'), '')`, which means it will store the minimum length and the corresponding substring.\n5. We start a loop with `i` ranging from 0 to 3 (inclusive).\n   - For `i = 0`:\n     - `ctr` is initialized to 0.\n     - We enter another loop with `j` ranging from 0 to 3.\n       - For `j = 0`: `ctr` becomes 1 (since `int(s[0])` is 1), and we don't update `res` because `ctr` is not equal to `k`.\n       - For `j = 1`: `ctr` becomes 1 (since `int(s[1])` is 0), and we don't update `res` because `ctr` is not equal to `k`.\n       - For `j = 2`: `ctr` becomes 2 (since `int(s[2])` is 1), and we update `res` to `(3, '101')` because `ctr` equals `k`.\n       - For `j = 3`: `ctr` remains 2 (since `int(s[3])` is 1), and we don't update `res` because the length of the substring is the same but we already have a valid one.\n   - For `i = 1`:\n     - `ctr` is initialized to 0.\n     - We enter another loop with `j` ranging from 1 to 3.\n       - For `j = 1`: `ctr` becomes 1 (since `int(s[1])` is 0), and we don't update `res` because `ctr` is not equal to `k`.\n       - For `j = 2`: `ctr` becomes 2 (since `int(s[2])` is 1), and we update `res` to `(2, '01')` because `ctr` equals `k` and the length of the substring is smaller than the previous one.\n       - For `j = 3`: `ctr` remains 2 (since `int(s[3])` is 1), and we don't update `res` because the length of the substring is the same but we already have a valid one.\n   - For `i = 2` and `i = 3`, no updates are made to `res` because the substrings do not meet the condition `ctr == k`.\n6.

Converting '75' to an integer gives 75, which is greater than 60. So, `ans` is incremented to 1.\n   - For the second string `'5303914400F9211'`, the last two characters of the substring from index -4 to -2 are '92'. Converting '92' to an integer gives 92, which is greater than 60. So, `ans` is incremented to 2.\n   - For the third string `'9273338290F4010'`, the last two characters of the substring from index -4 to -2 are '40'. Converting '40' to an integer gives 40, which is not greater than 60. So, `ans` remains 2.\n5.

The function `isFascinating` is defined, which takes a single argument `n`.\n2. The function is called with the argument `100`, so within the function, `n` is `100`.\n3. An empty string `t` is initialized.\n4. A loop runs from `1` to `3` (inclusive), and in each iteration, the current value of `i` multiplied by `n` is converted to a string and appended to `t`.\n   - For `i = 1`, `t` becomes '100'.\n   - For `i = 2`, `t` becomes '100200'.\n   - For `i = 3`, `t` becomes '100200300'.\n5. The variable `c` is assigned the result of `collections.Counter(t)`, which counts the occurrences of each character in `t`.\n6. The function checks if `c['0'] == 0` (which is `False` because there are three '0's in `t`), `len(c) == 9` (which is `False` because `t` contains only '0', '1', and '2'), and `len(t) == 9` (which is `False` because `t` has 9 characters but does not contain all digits from '1' to '9').\n7. Since all conditions are `False`, the function returns `False`.\n</think>\n<answer> isFascinating(n = 100) == False </answer>"], "solutions": ["isFascinating(n = 100) == False"]}

A list comprehension is used to create `qs` which contains all vowels from `s` in the order they appear: `qs = ['Y']`.\n4. The list `qs` is sorted, resulting in `qs = ['Y']` (no change since it's a single element).\n5. A variable `pos` is initialized to 0.\n6. A loop iterates over each character in `s`:\n   - For the first character 'l', it's not a vowel, so it's appended to `ans` as is.\n   - For the second character 'Y', it's a vowel, so the first element of `qs` ('Y') is appended to `ans`, and `pos` is incremented to 1.\n   - For the third character 'm', it's not a vowel, so it's appended to `ans` as is.\n   - For the fourth character 'p', it's not a vowel, so it's appended to `ans` as is.\n   - For the fifth character 'H', it's not a vowel, so it's appended to `ans` as is.\n7. After the loop, `ans` is `['l', 'Y', 'm', 'p', 'H']`.\n8. The function returns the joined string of `ans`, which is `'lYmph'`.\n\n</think>\n<answer> sortVowels(s = 'lYmpH') == 'lYmph' </answer>"], "solutions": ["sortVowels(s = 'lYmpH') == 'lYmph'"]}

For each combination of `a` and `b`, the innermost loop iterates over `c` from 0 to 2 (inclusive).\n7. The condition `if a + b + c == n` checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` equals 5.\n8. We need to find all combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` such that their sum is 5 and each is between 0 and 2 (inclusive).\n\nLet's list out the valid combinations:\n- (2, 2, 1): a + b + c = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5\n- (2, 1, 2): a + b + c = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5\n- (1, 2, 2): a + b + c = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n\nNo other combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given limits will sum up to 5. Therefore, there are exactly 3 valid combinations.\n\n9.
